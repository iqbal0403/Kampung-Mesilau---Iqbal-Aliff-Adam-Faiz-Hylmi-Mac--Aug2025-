            <h2><b>1. General Restriction</b></h2>
            <p>When visiting Kampung Mesilau, Sabah, it is important to respect local rules and environmental guidelines. Littering is strictly prohibited, especially in sensitive areas such as Mesilau Nature Park, hiking trails, and rivers, as the community places strong emphasis on eco-tourism and conservation.

            <p>Kampung Mesilau is a peaceful village, so loud noise or disruption such as playing loud music, shouting, or partying especially after 10:00 PM is discouraged.

Public alcohol consumption is generally frowned upon; if alcohol is consumed, it should be done discreetly and privately within accommodations, ensuring respect for local customs. Smoking is also restricted in certain areas.

Revealing clothing is considered inappropriate in this community setting.
